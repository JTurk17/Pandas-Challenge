QUICK NOTE ABOUT THE CODE:

When creating the final tables for "Scores by School Size" and "Scores by School Spending" at the end Pandas gave a warning due to changes that will be made in the future. 
I just wanted to note that this was not an error and the code still ran and produced the correct graphs underneath the warning message. 
I wasn't sure what to add to the code or where to pass the "observed=False" or "observed=True" line, so I decided
it would be best to leave it since it still ran, and revisit later. Just leaving this here to make sure the entire code is considered despite the warnings.
